## Abstract

A _square matrix_ is said to be **diagonally dominant** if its diagonal
elements are greater than or equal to the sum of all the other entries in that
particular row.

The general form of linear systems are of the form `Ax = b` where `x` and `b`
are vectors of size `N x 1` and `A` is a `N x N` square matrix.

While no partial pivoting is required while solving a linear system of such
matrices using the Guass-Jordan elimination, an interest is sparked while
thinking about the iterative algorithms that exist.

The most common iterative algorithms that exist to solve linear systems are:
* Iterative Jacobi Method
* Gauss-Seidel Method

## The Iterative Jacobi Method

TODO: Write about high level algorithm and mention implementation methods.
